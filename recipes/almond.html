		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>
			My version is pretty straightforward—a classic Italian dipping cookie. But
			you can add hazelnuts, pistachios, and any type of dried fruit. Or dip
			them in dark chocolate.
		</p>
		<h3>Ingredients</h3>
		<ul>
			<li> 2 cups all-purpose flour </li>
			<li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
			<li>¼ teaspoon fine salt</li>
			<li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter, room temperature</li>
			<li>1 cup white sugar</li>
			<li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
			<li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
			<li>2 large eggs</li>
			<li>¼ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
			<li>¾ teaspoon almond extract</li>
			<li>½ cup whole roasted almonds</li>
			<li>½ cup chopped roasted almonds</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Steps</h3>
		<ol>
			<li> Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt together in a mixing bowl. </li>
			<li>
				Place butter, 1 cup plus 1 tablespoon sugar, olive oil in a separate
				mixing bowl. Mix together thoroughly until mixture has a creamy texture.
				Add 1 egg; mix into butter/sugar mixture. Whisk in 2nd egg, vanilla
				extract, and almond extract; whisk until smooth. Add flour mixture. Mix
				until flour is incorporated. Add whole almonds and chopped almonds; mix
				in evenly. Cover bowl with plastic wrap; refrigerate 30 minutes.
			</li>
			<li>
				Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking
				sheet with a silicone mat.
			</li>
			<li>
				Divide dough in half. Place each half on a length of plastic wrap and
				shape into a log. Wrap with the plastic wrap and press into a shape
				about 3 or 4 inches wide and about 1/2 inch high. Transfer both pieces
				to prepared baking sheet leaving about 3 or 4 inches of space between
				them to allow for spreading.
			</li>
			<li>
				Bake in center of preheated oven until turning golden and a toothpick
				inserted into the center comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Let cool 15
				minutes before slicing.
			</li>
			<li> Reduce oven temperature to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). </li>
			<li>
				Cut each piece at a slight angle into 1/2- to 1 -inch thick slices with
				a serrated knife. Transfer pieces back to baking sheet in a single
				layer. Bake 12 minutes; remove from oven and flip pieces over. Return
				pan to oven and bake until biscotti are golden brown and crunchy, about
				20 minutes.
			</li>
			<li>
				Transfer biscotti to a cooling rack; let cool to room temperature.
			</li>
